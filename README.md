# PowerSC
Example files for testing PowerSC functionality.

These files will be used in the PowerSC Lab session (#1615) running at the IBM TechXchange Conference 2024 in Las Vegas, Nevada, USA in October 2024.

## Block listing examples
This includes some example files and a hashfile that includes the MD5 hash values for each of those example files. The hashfile can then be uploaded in the PowerSC GUI and applied as a Block list for each of the 3 Operating System types. 
In each managed / monitored LPAR one or more of the example files can be downloaded ad then scanned against to show the effects of idetifying a blocked file.
